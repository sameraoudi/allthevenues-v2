# Memory.md — allthevenues.com (v2)

*Current state, open work, and dated history. Update at every closeout: move finished items into the dated
history with a one-liner, add new open items, refresh "current state." Pairs with `CLAUDE.md` (how we work)
and `VISION.md` (north star).*

---

## Current state (as of 3 Jul 2026)

> Latest closeout: **All of U5 complete** (SEO). Head infra (meta/canonical/OG), event×city landing pages,
> the Locations mosaic, and dynamic sitemap.xml + robots.txt are live — on top of a fully-complete U4 (venue
> + provider admin). Next: the **launch track** in `docs/ATV-BACKLOG.md` — starting with #2 Become-a-Venue-
> Partner form — then **U6** (audit + apex cutover).

**Live on `staging.allthevenues.com`.** The full public shopfront + the admin to run it are built and
verified on staging. Core loop works end-to-end: browse → enquire → admin inbox → context-aware forward.

**Public site (final design + terminology):**
- Homepage (hero + featured venues + how-it-works), Coastal UAE Soft Blue design.
- **Venues:** `/venues` listing (filter sidebar, active-filter chips, horizontal cards, sort, pagination,
  mobile toggle) + `/venues/{slug}` detail (bounded gallery + self-hosted lightbox, sticky tabs, Key Info,
  "What makes it special" from `highlights`, map embed, venue website link, similar venues).
  **Keyword search (`q`)** in the hero + sidebar matches venue name / provider name / location (area +
  emirate), carried through sort/pagination as a removable chip.
- **Header nav** works on mobile (hamburger → full-width dropdown panel; Shortlist hidden ≤900px; desktop
  unchanged). The dead **Locations** link was removed (a real Locations browse page is planned for U5).
- **404** is a branded not-found page (Coastal UAE styling, map-pin icon, `.atv-btn` CTAs) — shared across
  all not-found routes.
- **Info/legal (#7):** `/about`, `/terms-of-use`, `/privacy-policy`, `/cookie-policy` (rendered from
  `docs/legal/*.md` via `views/page.php` + `.atv-legal` prose; Terms §10 strengthened image licence) +
  **`/contact`** (become-partner-style hero + overlapping form card; own `mode='contact'` enquiry with a
  reason dropdown → admin inbox with a "Contact" badge/filter + dedicated detail view, no forwarding). Partner
  form now links the live Terms/Privacy + states the image-permission consent. Placeholders + **UAE legal
  review** still pending.
- **Admin inbox** gained a mode filter (all modes), admin-only **delete** (transaction + CSRF + confirm +
  audit; `app.js` now loaded in the admin layout so `data-confirm` fires), and a tidied Venue(s) column.
- **SEO (U5):** every page emits a meta description + canonical (path-only, dedupes filtered listings) + OG/
  Twitter (`views/layout.php`). **Event×city landing pages** at `/venues/{event}-in-{emirate}` (templated
  intro + filtered results + internal links + FAQ w/ FAQPage JSON-LD + enquiry CTA), gated on ≥
  `LANDING_MIN_VENUES` (3); thin combos 301 to the filtered search; invalid → 404; resolves after real venue
  slugs. Venue cards now carry **View details + Enquire**. **Locations** `/locations` (see above). Dynamic
  **`/sitemap.xml`** (hubs + published venues + approved providers + qualifying landing combos) + domain-
  agnostic **`/robots.txt`** (disallow `/admin`).
- **Venue Providers:** `/providers` image-led cards (cover = **provider's own cover image if set, else** best
  venue image; type-icon chip; gradient fallback rare) + `/providers/{slug}` cover+avatar header, "Venues by
  this provider", provider info panel, managed enquiry panel. `/partners` → `/providers` 301. No public PII.
- **Become a Venue Partner:** `/become-a-venue-partner` (nav CTA repointed here from `/enquire`) — hero +
  value cards + provider form; submits as a `partner_signup` enquiry (structured: `company`/`provider_type`/
  `website`/`venues_managed`/`city_pref`/`notes`) into the admin inbox with its own badge, mode filter, and a
  dedicated "Partner request" detail view (no venue/forward panels). Reuses CSRF/honeypot/rate-limit/
  Turnstile/mail. Terms/Privacy links are stubs until backlog #7 (public go-live waits on them).
- **Event Types:** `/event-types` editorial mosaic — 6 image-led featured tiles (Wedding hero, Corporate
  tall, + Conference/Product Launch/Private Party/Exhibition) linking to `/venues?event_type={slug}`; top +
  bottom enquiry bridges; each tile gated on ≥1 published venue (Gala/Yacht auto-appear once tagged);
  count-threshold soft label ("Explore venues" under 5). Images live in `assets/img/event-types/{slug}.webp`.
- Enquiry is **context-aware**: venue-mode (specific venue), assisted-mode ("help me find"), partner-mode
  (`/enquire?provider=id`) — each shows the right fields; all land as tracked leads.

**Admin:**
- Auth + RBAC (**Administrator / Editor**; partner reserved), real name + role in the chrome, fail-closed
  gates, `/admin/users` management (create the assistant), audit_log.
- Lead inbox: list/filter/detail/status, CSV export, notes; **context-aware forwarding** (defaults the
  partner + email from the enquiry's linked venue).
- **Venue admin (U4a/U4c)** — full edit form + **add-venue create** (`/admin/venues/new`, auto-slug, draft
  default, then land on edit for images). Fields via a shared `_venue-fields.php` partial: provider
  assignment (`partner_id`, for routing), classification, capacity/pricing, website, **map_embed** (Google-
  Maps-iframe guarded, stored raw), rich-text content, and an **internal contact** (name/email/phone, never
  public). Audit on create + update.
- **U4b venue image management** (secure upload via `lib/upload`, WebP re-encode of full + thumb,
  set-primary, reorder, alt text, delete). Verified on prod.
- **U4d provider management** at `/admin/partners` (list + edit): org/slug/status/emirate/city/contact,
  **email** (fills migration gaps), **Verified/Featured** (independent), **type** (editable via
  `partner_group`), **single cover image** (WebP, overrides venue-derived cover), **commission_rate**
  (admin-only, tri-state). CSRF + RBAC (admin/editor) + audit throughout.

**Data:** 98 venues, ~68 approved providers migrated (latin1→utf8mb4, slugs, taxonomy re-tag, sanitized
HTML). `venues.website` backfilled 98/98. `venue_event_types` seeded 96/98 from `best_for` (Event Type
filter now works). Filter logic corrected (guest-band overlap; indoor/outdoor includes "both"). **Schema
grown for providers:** `partners.is_verified` (real column, replaces the `is_featured` alias),
`cover_image_path`/`cover_thumb_path`/`cover_image_alt`, `commission_rate DECIMAL(5,2) NULL` (NULL=unknown /
0=none / >0=rate), and `partner_group` repurposed as the editable type. **Venues** gained
`contact_name`/`contact_email`/`contact_phone` (migration 011). Migrations 008–011 applied on prod. Samer
began filling provider emails + adding providers/venues via the new admin.

**In progress:** none — U4, U5, and launch-track **#2, #4, #6, #7, U3c** all complete (+ the docs-exposure
security fix). Next: **#5** reporting → **#8/U6** audit + apex cutover. Also open: **#9** image
rights/provenance (schema + admin), **#3** provider portal (Phase 2), **#1** card-hover polish. See
`docs/ATV-BACKLOG.md`.

## Open work

> **Post-launch backlog:** Samer's 8-item action list (partner portal, multi-venue shortlist, reporting,
> provider ownership, Become-a-Venue-Partner form, contact/legal pages, card-hover polish, launch audit) is
> reconciled against current state + sequenced in **`docs/ATV-BACKLOG.md`**. Decided (Jul 2026): **lean
> launch** on the Phase-1 track, provider portal ships as the first Phase-2 unit.

**Admin build-out (U4): ✅ complete** (U4a edit, U4b images, U4c add-venue, U4d provider management).

**Monetization & tiering (Phase 2/3 — see `docs/ATV-TIERS.md`):**
- Homepage **Featured Venues** driven by `is_featured` (DB) + a **Venue of the Month** editorial slot.
- Recommended/relevance **sort** (relevance + completeness + image quality + verified + featured boost +
  freshness + editorial). `tier`/`provider_tier` fields; admin controls to set them.
- A **campaigns/placements** table (which venue/provider holds which paid slot, when) + billing + reporting;
  the **partner portal** (self-serve) — Phase 2/3.

**SEO & launch:**
- **U5 ✅ complete** — SEO head infra, event×city landing pages, Locations, sitemap.xml + robots.txt.
- **Launch track** (see `docs/ATV-BACKLOG.md`, lean-launch order): #2 partner form → #6 provider-ownership
  fields → #4 multi-venue shortlist → #7 legal/contact/about → U3c historical enquiries → #5 reporting
  foundation → #8/U6 audit.
- **U6** launch hardening: notifications set, GoatCounter events, **301s from legacy URLs**, mobile QA,
  security check, backup + rollback, **cutover** staging → apex domain (retire legacy code, tailored CSP
  replaces any stopgap).

**Polish (approved, cascade platform-wide):**
- **Card hover effect** (approved on homepage) — apply to all cards.
- **Button capitalization** rule — first letter capital on every button.

**Content track (Samer):**
- Tag the **2 untagged venues** + fill the empty event types. **Tagging venues to Gala Dinner / Yacht Event
  auto-activates their tiles** on `/event-types` (they're built + gated, just hidden until they have ≥1
  published venue) — add `gala-dinner.webp` / `yacht-event.webp` to `assets/img/event-types/` when ready.
- Fill remaining **provider emails** (started) + reconcile the **~4 NULL `partner_id`** venues; set provider
  **type / Verified / commission** where known via the new provider admin.
- Real venue **photography** + **provider cover images** replacing migrated/placeholder imagery where weak.

**Optional / low priority:**
- **U3c** backfill the 2,378 legacy `inquiry` rows (junk-filtered) into `enquiries` — only if lead history
  is wanted.

---

## Dated history

**3 Jul 2026**
- Split ATV out of the shared sameroudi.com Cowork project into its own project + repo-canonical docs
  (this `CLAUDE.md` / `Memory.md` / `VISION.md` + `docs/`).
- U4 admin foundation: RBAC (Administrator/Editor), real name in chrome, `/admin/users`, fail-closed gates,
  audit on user changes.
- Google-Maps CSP `frame-src https://www.google.com` moved into the **repo** `.htaccess` (persists across
  deploys) after a manual prod edit was clobbered.
- Venue Providers redesign (image-led cards, cover+avatar header, type-icon chip, glass button contrast fix,
  "View" footer) + **Partner→Venue Provider** terminology rename + `/partners`→`/providers` 301.
- Consolidated the monetization/terminology strategy into `docs/ATV-TIERS.md`.
- `venues.website` (98/98) + `venue_event_types` (96/98) backfilled from legacy; venue-detail P0 fixes
  (gallery overlap, lightbox, restored map + website link); guest/indoor-outdoor filter logic corrected.
- U4a venue edit + editable `highlights` field.
- U4b venue image management: secure upload (`lib/upload` allowlist + `getimagesize()` real-image check +
  random filenames), WebP re-encode of full (≤2000px) + thumb (≤600px) stripping EXIF, PNG transparency
  preserved; set-primary/reorder/alt/delete with per-venue ownership + CSRF guards + audit rows. Verified on
  prod: jpg/png → WebP, transparency kept, rejects (.svg/.gif/.php.jpg/>12MB/cross-venue/missing-CSRF) all
  fail clean, `/uploads/test.php` → 403 (non-exec confirmed).
- Committed the canonical docs to the repo (`CLAUDE`/`Memory`/`VISION` + rebuild-plan/tiers/preview) — they'd
  only existed in the working copy after the project split.
- **U4d provider management** (schema-before-code throughout; migrations 008–010 applied on prod):
  - **U4d-1/2** `partners.is_verified` real column + backfill = is_featured; `partner_is_verified()` now reads
    it (Verified independent of Featured); dropped dead `logo_path` from provider SELECTs.
  - **U4d-3a** `/admin/partners` list + edit (status/emirate/city/contact/**email**/website/about +
    independent Verified/Featured), CSRF+RBAC+audit; swapped the dispatch placeholder for a real controller.
  - **U4d-3c** provider **single cover image** — `lib/upload` refactored to a shared core + `upload_partner_cover`;
    admin upload/replace/alt/delete; public card (thumb) + detail hero (full) prefer the provider cover,
    fall back to the venue-derived image; `partners.cover_*` columns.
  - **U4d-3d** `commission_rate` (admin-only, tri-state NULL/0/>0), validated 0–100, never public.
  - **U4d-3b** editable **provider type** stored as the bucket label in `partner_group`;
    `partner_org_type_expr()` prefers it (else the migrated notes value); `/providers` type filter + public
    display update for free.
- **`/event-types` page** built from the approved design lock (`docs/atv-event-types-preview.html`): editorial
  mosaic, 6 gated image tiles → `/venues?event_type` filter, count-threshold soft label, top+bottom enquiry
  bridges, inline-SVG icons (no CDN), real nav wiring (header+footer). Images committed under
  `assets/img/event-types/`.
- **Public polish:** keyword search (`q`) on hero + `/venues` (name / provider / location; removable chip,
  carried through sort+pagination); mobile-nav fix (hamburger → full-width dropdown panel, Shortlist hidden
  ≤900px, desktop unchanged); removed the dead **Locations** nav link (real page deferred to U5); shorter
  hero tagline.
- **U4c add-venue + completed venue edit** (finishes U4): migration 011 (venues contact columns); exposed
  the fields the edit form was missing — provider (`partner_id`), website, `map_embed` (guarded, raw),
  internal contact — via a shared `_venue-fields.php` partial; new `/admin/venues/new` create flow
  (auto-unique slug, draft default, audit 'create', redirect to edit for images) + "New venue" button.
- **Branded 404** — Coastal UAE styling, map-pin icon, friendlier copy, `.atv-btn` CTAs (replaces bare
  Bootstrap).
- **U5 SEO (complete):** U5-a head infra (meta/canonical/OG on layout + per-page); U5-b event×city landing
  pages (`/venues/{event}-in-{emirate}`, templated intro+FAQ+JSON-LD+internal links, gated ≥3, thin→301,
  invalid→404, resolves after real venue slugs) + venue-card Enquire action sitewide; U5-c Locations mosaic
  (`/locations`, city images + venue-photo/gradient fallback, nav link restored); U5-d dynamic sitemap.xml
  (175 URLs) + domain-agnostic robots.txt. Design locks: `atv-landing-preview.html`, `atv-locations-preview.html`.
- **Planning:** reconciled Samer's 8-item action list into `docs/ATV-BACKLOG.md`; decided **lean launch**
  (portal is first Phase-2 unit).
- **Launch #2 — Become a Venue Partner** (`/become-a-venue-partner`): migration 012 (enquiries.mode
  `partner_signup` + `provider_type`/`website`/`venues_managed`); dedicated page (hero + value cards + form),
  submits as a structured `partner_signup` lead into the inbox (own badge + mode filter + "Partner request"
  detail); nav CTA repointed. Design lock `atv-partner-signup-preview.html`. (Gotcha: a refinements commit
  shipped un-pushed — confirm `git push` reached origin before deploying.)
- **Launch #7 — info/legal/contact** (`/about`, `/terms-of-use`, `/privacy-policy`, `/cookie-policy` from
  `docs/legal/*.md`; strengthened Terms §10; `/contact` with `mode='contact'` + reason dropdown + admin
  detail/badge/filter, no forwarding; partner-form image consent + live Terms/Privacy links). Admin inbox:
  mode filter, admin-only delete (confirm+audit), tidied Venue(s) column, `app.js` loaded in admin layout.
  Legal drafts saved to `docs/legal/`; **#9 image-rights plan** captured in the backlog.
- **U3c — historical enquiries imported.** Legacy `inquiry` (~2,311 rows) was NOT sqlmap-junk after all —
  mostly real (2017→2026). Migration 015 added `enquiries.is_historical` + `legacy_id` (unique).
  `db/backfill_legacy_enquiries.php` (CLI-only, dry-run-by-default, idempotent via `legacy_id`, legacy DB
  creds supplied at runtime — placeholder in repo) imported all: field-mapped, `inquiry_date`→`created_at`
  preserved, guest→band + event-type→slug mapped, **1,971 best-effort venue links** (legacy name→slug), spam
  scored → `status='spam'` (116), real → `closed` (2,195), `is_historical=1`. **Samer then deleted the 116
  spam rows** (+ their `enquiry_venues`/`lead_routing`). NB: re-running the backfill would re-import them.
- **Admin enquiries pager** is now windowed (First/Prev/… /Next/Last + "Page X of Y") via reusable
  `views/partials/admin-pager.php` — the 2.3k import had ballooned it to 93 links.
- **SECURITY fix:** `docs/` + root `*.md` (CLAUDE/Memory/VISION/backlog/previews) were deploying to the
  docroot and **publicly served** (leaked infra: DB name, `/home1/...` paths, repo, deploy-key alias). Now
  **`.htaccess` denies `/docs/*` + any `.md`** (403); legal pages unaffected (they read `docs/legal/*.md` via
  the PHP filesystem, not HTTP). *Still TODO: manually delete the already-deployed `docs/` + root `.md` from
  the staging docroot (rsync doesn't remove them); optional hardening — exclude them in `.cpanel.yml`.*
- **Launch #6 — provider ownership provenance:** migration 013 added `venues.management_source`
  (unassigned/admin_assigned/provider_created/provider_claimed/legacy_import) + `provider_assigned_at`/`_by`
  (backfilled 94 legacy_import / 4 unassigned). Venue save/create now auto-sets source + assigned_at/by when
  the provider changes (clearing → unassigned; unchanged keeps prior source); edit shows read-only
  provider-managed status/source/when/who. `managed_by_provider` is derived (`partner_id IS NOT NULL`).

**Late Jun 2026 (rebuild through U3):**
- U0 scaffold (front controller, `lib/` ported, tailored CSP, self-hosted assets).
- U1 schema (14 tables) + legacy→new migration (venues/providers/images, sanitize-on-import) on staging DB.
- U2 public browse (venues list + detail) + homepage on the Coastal UAE design; venue-pages visual pass.
- U3 enquiry system (context-aware modes) + admin lead inbox + context-aware forwarding.
- Partner (provider) public pages (pre-redesign).
- Infra fixes: rsync `--no-perms` (403), MySQL-5.7 compat (not MariaDB), app-owned session path (csrf
  fatal), subdomain docroot, taxonomy → 17 venue types + indoor/outdoor.

**Decision:** rebuild the app + migrate the data (legacy code carried systemic security debt); build on a
staging subdomain against a fresh DB (`sameraou_atv2`), cut over when ready. (Full rationale:
`docs/ATV-REBUILD-PLAN.md`.)
